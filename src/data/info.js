    introduction: "Courteous and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its orbit. It's about two and a half years that I'm fascinated by web and programming, e.g developing apps and building websites with ReactJs. I have gained enormous experience by working on my project in Zhongxi with Jimmy Kessee which was fun and challenging. I'm keen to gain more experience in the field. For this reason, I'm looking for a company willing to offer me placement among its developers. In return, I would offer my full commitment, and coding enthusiasm to bring value to your company. I am therefore currently looking for a place where I can work with skillful developers on real-world applications.",
